"""
Remote state middleware for Inngest. This middleware allows you to store state
where you want, rather than in Inngest's infrastructure. This is useful for:
- Reducing bandwidth to/from the Inngest server.
- Avoiding step output size limits.

NOT STABLE! This is an experimental feature and may change in the future. If
you'd like to use it, we recommend copying this file into your source code.
